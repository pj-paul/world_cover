How to run the code:

0. Clone the repo and cd into this directory.
1. Run `load_data_db.sh` like this: bash ./load_data_db.sh ../../Data/WC_Dump/Raw ../../Data/WC_Dump/Clean WC_Dump <postgres_username>
2. You don't need to worry about the sql file, they get consumed by `load_data_db.sh`.
3. You can now open up the rmd file and start running the code.
